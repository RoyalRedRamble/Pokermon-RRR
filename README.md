### The House of Maus

Making the mice a **Full House**hold name. 

Tandemaus use **Population Bomb**: "90% chance to give +5 Mult when card is scored. Mult is **doubled** per trigger but stops triggering on first failure. Resets after each hand."

Maushold both use **Population Bomb EX**: "90% chance to give x1.5 Mult when card is scored. Increased by 0.5 per trigger but stops triggering on first failure. Resets after each hand."

### The Diamond Gremlin

Watch out, Sableye is hungry for every Diamond you aren't using! On the other hand, having a belly full of diamonds certainly makes him a lot more valuable. At least he pays you for what he eats!
And if you can mega evolve him, he turns all that valuable diamond munching into a hefty power up!

| Sableye | Destroys Diamond cards left in hand after scoring <br/>Gives $1 and gains $1 of sell value for every card consumed |

### The Tricky Swords

Aegislash can change form and flip your entire hand giving you a major advantage, if you can remember what your cards were!
